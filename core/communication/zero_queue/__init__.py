"""The zeroqueue module provides a robust messaging interface for inter-process and inter-node communication using ZeroMQ.

This module implements the following classes:
- ZeroQueue: A PUB/SUB-based queue suitable for message passing between processes on a single machine.
- ZeroQueueProducer: A message producer that employs the REQ/REP pattern, supporting message buffering and automatic retries.
- ZeroQueueConsumer: A message consumer based on the REQ/REP pattern for receiving messages from a producer.

These classes facilitate efficient and reliable messaging for distributed system architectures, enabling asynchronous communication and seamless data transfer.
